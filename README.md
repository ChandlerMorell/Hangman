# Hangman
 Simple Python-made game of hangman. 
 
Hangman is a popular word game. The game consists of a gallows, stickman, and a word. The word is hidden, and you are to guess it. With each right guess, a new letter or amount of letters is revealed. You can continue to guess as the word fills up, or if you're confident, guess the entire word. With each wrong guess, a new body part is added to the stick man (head, torso, right arm, left arm, right leg, left leg). As the stick man fills in, you run out of attempts (six in total). The game is over when you run out of attempts.
